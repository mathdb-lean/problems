Converted from another corpus. `source` names it, `source_version`
pins the revision, and `source_locator` points at the one
declaration this came from. Every `source_` field describes that
declaration as it stands there, not as it stands here.

Read `track` for whether the problem is solved, which is a fact
about mathematics. `source_has_lean_proof` is a different claim --
whether that corpus holds a machine-checked proof -- and is false
for almost every problem, because it is a statement repository.
