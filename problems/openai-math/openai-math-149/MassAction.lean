Converted from github.com/openai/math. `source_locator` names the comparator
challenge this came from and `source_solution_module` the module there that
proves it; both are at `source_version`. The definitions are the challenge's
own; each sorried theorem became `<name>_statement`, and `Problem.Target`
below conjoins them. `track` is solved because comparator accepted OpenAI's
proof against this very statement. Whether the statement says what the paper's
title says is what the scope note, carried as a caveat, is about.

- prose: Proves the permanence conjecture for every finite weakly reversible mass-action system with fixed positive rate constants. Every positive stoichiometric compatibility class, even an unbounded one, has a common compact convex forward-invariant absorbing set. All positive trajectories in that class therefore eventually share positive lower and finite upper concentration bounds. ([Lean](lean/docs/149.md)) We prove the boundedness and persistence conjectures for finite weakly reversible mass-action systems with positive constant reaction rates. For every positive initial condition, the solution exists for all forward time, and every concentration remains bounded above and bounded away from zero. The bounds may depend on the initial condition, and no boundedness assumption is imposed on its stoichiometric compatibility class.

/- Formalization scope, from lean/docs/149.md: The boundedness and persistence conjectures for mass-action systems ask whether positive concentrations remain finite and separated from zero. The formalization proves this for every finite weakly reversible reaction network with positive constant reaction rates and every strictly positive initial state. A global forward solution exists, and one $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ bounds every concentration of every global forward solution between $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ for all nonnegative times. The bound may depend on the network, rates, and initial state. -/
