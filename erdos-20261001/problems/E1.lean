Converted from another corpus. `source` names it, `source_version`
pins the revision, and `source_locator` points at the one
declaration this came from. Every `source_` field describes that
declaration as it stands there, not as it stands here.

Read `track` for whether the problem is solved, which is a fact
about mathematics. `source_has_lean_proof` is a different claim --
whether that corpus holds a machine-checked proof -- and is false
for almost every problem, because it is a statement repository.

- prose: If $A\subseteq\{1, ..., N\}$ with $|A| = n$ is such that the subset sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are distinct for all $S\subseteq A$ then $$ N \gg 2 ^ n. $$ This conjecture is false. A machine-checked disproof constructs sum-distinct sets for which $N / 2^n$ tends to zero.

A finite set of naturals $A$ is said to be a sum-distinct set for $N \in \mathbb{N}$ if
$A\subseteq\{1, ..., N\}$ and the sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are distinct for all $S\subseteq A$

A finite set of real numbers is said to be sum-distinct if all the subset sums differ by
